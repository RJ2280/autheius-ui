# Lesson 1: What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective prompts to elicit desired outputs from large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, LaMDA, and others.  It's not just about typing a question and hoping for the best; it's about strategically designing your input to guide the LLM towards a specific, high-quality response.  Think of it as being a skilled interviewer â€“ you need to ask the right questions in the right way to get the information you need.

## Why is Prompt Engineering Important?

LLMs are incredibly powerful, but their responses are directly dependent on the input they receive.  A poorly constructed prompt can lead to:

* **Incoherent or nonsensical outputs:**  The model might struggle to understand your intent, resulting in irrelevant or nonsensical answers.
* **Factual inaccuracies:**  LLMs can sometimes "hallucinate" facts, and a poorly designed prompt can exacerbate this issue.
* **Bias and harmful outputs:**  If your prompt is biased or contains harmful language, the model may reflect those biases in its response.
* **Inefficient use of resources:**  Poorly crafted prompts might require multiple iterations to achieve the desired outcome, wasting time and computational resources.

Effective prompt engineering, conversely, allows you to:

* **Control the style and tone of the output:**  Specify whether you want a formal or informal response, a creative story, or a technical explanation.
* **Improve the accuracy and relevance of the output:**  Guide the LLM towards the specific information you're seeking.
* **Reduce the likelihood of harmful or biased outputs:**  Frame your prompts carefully to mitigate potential risks.
* **Maximize the efficiency of your interactions with the LLM:**  Get the results you want with fewer iterations.


## Key Concepts in Prompt Engineering

Several key concepts underpin effective prompt engineering:

* **Specificity:**  The more precise your prompt, the better the LLM can understand your intentions.  Avoid ambiguity and vagueness.
* **Context:**  Providing relevant background information helps the LLM understand the context of your request.
* **Constraints:**  Setting constraints, such as length limits or specific formats, can improve the quality and consistency of the output.
* **Iteration:**  Experimentation is crucial.  Iteratively refine your prompts based on the LLM's responses.
* **Few-Shot Learning:**  Providing a few examples in your prompt can help guide the LLM towards the desired output.


## Example Prompts: Good vs. Bad

Let's compare a poorly crafted prompt with a well-crafted one:

**Bad Prompt:**  `Write something about dogs.`

This prompt is too vague.  The LLM might write anything from a short sentence to a lengthy essay, and the quality and relevance are unpredictable.


**Good Prompt:**  `Write a 100-word short story about a golden retriever puppy learning to fetch.`

This prompt is much more specific. It specifies the length, genre, and subject matter, significantly improving the likelihood of a relevant and high-quality response.


##  Practical Techniques

Here are some practical techniques you can use to improve your prompts:

* **Use keywords:**  Include relevant keywords to help the LLM focus on the desired topic.
* **Specify the desired format:**  Request a list, a paragraph, a poem, code, etc.
* **Use examples:**  Provide a few examples of the desired output to guide the LLM.
* **Experiment with different phrasing:**  Try different ways of expressing your request to see which yields the best results.


##  Hands-on Exercise

Try crafting prompts for the following tasks, focusing on specificity and context:

1.  Summarize the plot of Hamlet in five bullet points.
2.  Generate a Python function to calculate the factorial of a number.
3.  Write a limerick about a cat sitting on a mat.

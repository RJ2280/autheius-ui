# Lesson 39: Planning and Goal Setting in Agentic Systems

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Learn how agents plan, prioritize, and execute long-term goals.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- Agentic vs reactive systems
- Emergence and unpredictability
- Planning algorithms and goal trees
- Multi-agent protocols and messaging
- Feedback mechanisms and self-evaluation
- Industry case studies

## ðŸ§ª Practice Tasks

- Simulate emergent behavior using simple agents
- Build a goal tree and execution plan
- Create a multi-agent negotiation scenario
- Implement a feedback loop for agent refinement

## ðŸ”® Future Trends

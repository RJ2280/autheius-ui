# Lesson 16: Embedding Models and Document Chunking

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Master embedding models and techniques for splitting documents into chunks.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- RAG architecture and flow
- Connecting LLMs to external data
- Embedding generation and storage
- Query routing and scoring
- Performance benchmarking

## ðŸ§ª Practice Tasks

- Build a RAG agent using LangChain
- Index documents with FAISS or Pinecone
- Run semantic queries and evaluate results

## ðŸ”® Future Trends

- Hybrid RAG + agentic systems
- Real-time retrieval pipelines
- Privacy-preserving retrieval

# Lesson 18: Evaluating RAG Agent Performance

## 🎯 Objective

Evaluate RAG agents using metrics like accuracy, latency, and relevance.

## 🧠 Overview

- RAG architecture and flow
- Connecting LLMs to external data
- Embedding generation and storage
- Query routing and scoring
- Performance benchmarking

## 🧪 Practice Tasks

- Build a RAG agent using LangChain
- Index documents with FAISS or Pinecone
- Run semantic queries and evaluate results

## 🔮 Future Trends

- Hybrid RAG + agentic systems
- Real-time retrieval pipelines
- Privacy-preserving retrieval

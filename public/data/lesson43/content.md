# Lesson 43: Introduction to AI Reasoning Models

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Understand what reasoning models are and how they differ from general-purpose LLMs.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- Reasoning vs prediction
- Chain-of-thought logic
- Model transparency and auditability
- Cost-performance tradeoffs
- Scientific reasoning and reproducibility

## ðŸ§ª Practice Tasks

- Compare reasoning outputs from Magistral and o3-pro
- Build a logic chain for a multi-step problem
- Evaluate model transparency using benchmark datasets
- Simulate a scientific workflow using DeepSeek R1

## ðŸ”® Future Trends

- Reasoning agents with memory
- Self-verifying logic chains
- Domain-specific reasoning models

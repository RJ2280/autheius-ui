# Lesson 38: Emergent Behavior in Autonomous Agents

## 🎯 Objective

Explore emergent behavior and how agents develop unexpected capabilities.

## 🧠 Overview

- Agentic vs reactive systems
- Emergence and unpredictability
- Planning algorithms and goal trees
- Multi-agent protocols and messaging
- Feedback mechanisms and self-evaluation
- Industry case studies

## 🧪 Practice Tasks

- Simulate emergent behavior using simple agents
- Build a goal tree and execution plan
- Create a multi-agent negotiation scenario
- Implement a feedback loop for agent refinement

## 🔮 Future Trends

- Fully autonomous agent ecosystems
- Agentic governance and policy enforcement
- AI agents with emotional modeling

# Lesson 41: Self-Improving Agents and Feedback Loops

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Implement feedback loops that allow agents to learn and improve over time.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- Agentic vs reactive systems
- Emergence and unpredictability
- Planning algorithms and goal trees
- Multi-agent protocols and messaging
- Feedback mechanisms and self-evaluation
- Industry case studies

## ðŸ§ª Practice Tasks

- Simulate emergent behavior using simple agents
- Build a goal tree and execution plan
- Create a multi-agent negotiation scenario
- Implement a feedback loop for agent refinement

## ðŸ”® Future Trends

- Fully autonomous agent ecosystems
- Agentic governance and policy enforcement
- AI agents with emotional modeling

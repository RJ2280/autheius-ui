# Lesson 7: Introduction to Generative AI

This lesson introduces the fascinating world of Generative AI, exploring its core concepts, common techniques, and applications. We will move beyond simple discriminative models and delve into the realm of models that *create* new data instances.


## 7.1 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a class of artificial intelligence algorithms capable of generating new data instances that resemble the training data in terms of statistical properties.  Unlike discriminative models which focus on classification or prediction (e.g., classifying images as cats or dogs), generative models aim to learn the underlying probability distribution of the data and then sample from it to generate new, similar data.

**Key Differences from Discriminative Models:**

| Feature          | Discriminative Model                               | Generative Model                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**         | Predict a label or value given input features       | Learn the underlying data distribution and generate new data |
| **Output**        | Class label, probability, regression value          | New data instance (image, text, audio, etc.)         |
| **Example**      | Image classifier, spam filter                      | Image generator, text summarizer                     |


## 7.2 Types of Generative Models

Several prominent techniques power Generative AI.  Here are a few key examples:

* **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**  VAEs learn a compressed representation (latent space) of the input data and then use this representation to generate new data. They utilize a probabilistic approach, incorporating latent variables to capture uncertainty.

* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator that creates new data and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and generated data.  They engage in a "minimax" game, where the generator aims to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator aims to accurately identify generated data. This adversarial training leads to increasingly realistic outputs.

* **Diffusion Models:**  These models work by adding noise to data until it becomes pure noise, and then learning to reverse this process to generate data from noise.  They've recently shown impressive results in generating high-quality images.

* **Autoregressive Models:** These models generate data sequentially, predicting the next element based on the preceding elements.  Examples include language models like GPT-3 and image generation models based on pixel-by-pixel prediction.


## 7.3 Applications of Generative AI

Generative AI's applications are rapidly expanding across diverse fields:

* **Image Generation:** Creating realistic images, art, and enhancing existing images.
* **Text Generation:** Writing stories, articles, code, and translating languages.
* **Audio Generation:** Creating music, sound effects, and voice synthesis.
* **Drug Discovery:** Designing new molecules and predicting their properties.
* **Robotics:** Generating control policies for robots in complex environments.


## 7.4 Code Example (Conceptual):

This example demonstrates the basic idea of a GAN's training loop.  It's a simplified illustration and requires a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch for actual implementation.


```python
# This is a highly simplified conceptual example.  Actual implementation requires a deep learning framework.

# Generator network (creates fake data)
generator = ...

# Discriminator network (distinguishes real from fake)
discriminator = ...

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Get real data
    real_data = ...

    # Generate fake data
    fake_data = generator(...)

    # Train discriminator
    discriminator.train(real_data, fake_data)

    # Train generator
    generator.train(discriminator)
```

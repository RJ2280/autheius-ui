# Lesson 5: Prompt Tuning vs Fine-Tuning â€” When and Why

This lesson delves into the crucial differences between prompt tuning and fine-tuning, two prominent techniques for adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific tasks.  We'll explore their strengths, weaknesses, and when to choose one over the other.

## Understanding the Landscape

Before diving into the specifics, let's establish a common understanding. Both prompt tuning and fine-tuning aim to improve an LLM's performance on a downstream task.  However, they achieve this through different mechanisms and have distinct implications regarding computational cost and performance.

* **Fine-tuning:** This involves updating *all* or a significant portion of the LLM's weights using a new dataset specific to the target task.  Think of it as a complete retraining process, albeit on a pre-trained model.

* **Prompt Tuning:** This is a parameter-efficient approach that involves learning a small set of task-specific parameters *in addition to* the pre-trained model. The core LLM weights remain frozen.  These new parameters are used to modify the input prompt before it's fed to the LLM.


## Prompt Tuning: A Deep Dive

Prompt tuning leverages the power of prompting techniques by learning optimal prompts for specific tasks.  Instead of altering the LLM itself, we learn a small set of "prompt embeddings" that are concatenated with the input before being processed.


**Advantages:**

* **Computational Efficiency:** Requires significantly less computational resources compared to fine-tuning, both in terms of training time and memory.
* **Parameter Efficiency:** Only a small number of parameters need to be trained, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments.
* **Less Prone to Overfitting:** With fewer parameters, the risk of overfitting to the training data is reduced.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Limited Performance:** May not achieve the same level of performance as fine-tuning, especially on complex tasks.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Requires careful design of the initial prompt templates.


**Example (Conceptual):**

Let's say we want to fine-tune an LLM for sentiment analysis.

**Without Prompt Tuning:**  The input would be directly fed to the LLM.

**With Prompt Tuning:**  We'd learn a small vector (prompt embedding) that's concatenated with the input before being fed to the model.  The model learns to interpret this combined input to perform sentiment analysis.

```python
# Conceptual representation - not actual code
prompt_embedding = learn_prompt_embedding(training_data)
input_text = "This movie is amazing!"
modified_input = concatenate(input_text, prompt_embedding)
sentiment = lmm(modified_input)
```


## Fine-tuning: A Detailed Look

Fine-tuning adjusts the LLM's weights directly using backpropagation on a task-specific dataset.  This allows for a more significant adaptation to the target task.


**Advantages:**

* **High Performance:** Generally achieves better performance than prompt tuning, especially for complex tasks.
* **Adaptability:** Can adapt to a wider range of tasks.

**Disadvantages:**

* **Computational Cost:** Requires substantial computational resources for training.
* **Overfitting Risk:**  Higher risk of overfitting, particularly with limited training data.
* **Catastrophic Forgetting:**  May lead to a decrease in performance on other tasks the model was previously trained on.


**Example (Conceptual):**

In the same sentiment analysis example, fine-tuning would involve adjusting the weights of the LLM itself based on the training data.


```python
# Conceptual representation - not actual code
model = pretrained_llm()
model.train(sentiment_analysis_dataset) #  Updates model weights directly
sentiment = model("This movie is amazing!")
```


## When to Choose Which?

The choice between prompt tuning and fine-tuning depends on several factors:

| Factor          | Prompt Tuning                               | Fine-Tuning                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Computational Resources** | Low                                         | High                                          |
| **Data Availability**     | Can work with smaller datasets               | Benefits from larger datasets                   |
| **Task Complexity**    | Better suited for simpler tasks               | Better suited for complex tasks                 |
| **Performance Goal**   | Acceptable performance is sufficient           | High accuracy is crucial                       |
| **Risk of Overfitting** | Lower                                        | Higher                                         |


**In summary:**

* Use **prompt tuning** when resources are limited, data is scarce, and performance requirements aren't extremely stringent.
* Use **fine-tuning** when high performance is crucial, sufficient data is available, and computational resources are not a major constraint.


This lesson provides a foundational understanding of prompt tuning and fine-tuning.  Further exploration into specific implementations and advanced techniques is encouraged.

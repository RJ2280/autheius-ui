# Lesson 5: Prompt Tuning vs Fine-Tuning â€” When and Why

This lesson delves into the crucial differences between prompt tuning and fine-tuning in the context of large language models (LLMs). We'll explore their strengths, weaknesses, and when to choose one over the other.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

* Define prompt tuning and fine-tuning.
* Identify the key differences between prompt tuning and fine-tuning.
* Understand the computational costs associated with each method.
* Determine which technique is best suited for a given task and dataset size.
* Implement basic prompt tuning and fine-tuning using example code snippets.


## 5.1 What is Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning involves adjusting the weights of a pre-trained LLM on a downstream task using a new dataset. This process adapts the model's existing knowledge to a specific application.

**Advantages:**

* Can achieve high accuracy on specific tasks.
* Leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model.

**Disadvantages:**

* Requires a significant amount of labeled data.
* Computationally expensive, requiring substantial GPU resources and time.
* Prone to catastrophic forgetting: the model may forget aspects of its pre-trained knowledge.
* Risk of overfitting, especially with smaller datasets.


**Example (Conceptual):**

Imagine fine-tuning a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis.  You would feed it a dataset of tweets labeled as positive or negative.  The model's weights are then updated to better classify new tweets.


## 5.2 What is Prompt Tuning?

Prompt tuning involves adding a small number of learnable parameters to the input prompt rather than modifying the model's weights. These parameters are then optimized to improve performance on the downstream task.

**Advantages:**

* Significantly reduces computational cost compared to fine-tuning.
* Requires significantly less data than fine-tuning.
* Less prone to catastrophic forgetting.
* Can be more efficient in terms of memory usage.


**Disadvantages:**

* May not achieve the same level of accuracy as fine-tuning, especially with complex tasks.
* Effectiveness depends heavily on the design of the prompt and the task.


**Example (Conceptual):**

Let's use the same sentiment analysis example. Instead of changing the model's weights, we add a small set of learnable parameters to the beginning of the tweet text.  These parameters are then trained to guide the model towards more accurate sentiment classification.


## 5.3  Comparison Table

| Feature          | Fine-Tuning                     | Prompt Tuning                      |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Model Parameters | Adjusted                         | Mostly unchanged                    |
| Data Required    | Large                           | Relatively small                    |
| Computational Cost | High                             | Low                               |
| Accuracy         | Potentially higher               | Potentially lower                  |
| Catastrophic Forgetting | Higher risk                     | Lower risk                         |


## 5.4 When to Use Which Technique?

* **Fine-tuning:** Choose fine-tuning when:
    * You have a large labeled dataset.
    * High accuracy is paramount.
    * Computational resources are readily available.
    * The task is complex and requires significant adaptation of the pre-trained model.

* **Prompt Tuning:** Choose prompt tuning when:
    * You have limited labeled data.
    * Computational resources are constrained.
    * You need a quick and efficient solution.
    * The task is relatively simple, and the pre-trained model already possesses substantial relevant knowledge.


## 5.5  Code Example (Conceptual - requires specific library integration)

This section would typically include code examples demonstrating both fine-tuning and prompt tuning using a library like Hugging Face Transformers.  Due to the complexity and length of such examples, they are omitted here but would be included in a practical implementation of this lesson.  The example would show how to load a pre-trained model, prepare the data, train the model (either via fine-tuning or prompt tuning), and evaluate its performance.


## 5.6  Further Exploration

* Explore different prompt engineering techniques to enhance the effectiveness of prompt tuning.
* Investigate adapter-based methods as a compromise between fine-tuning and prompt tuning.
* Research the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of both methods.


This lesson provided a foundational understanding of prompt tuning and fine-tuning.  Further exploration and practical implementation are crucial for solidifying your understanding and mastering these techniques.

# Lesson 50: Capstone Project: Deploying a Full AI Agent System

This capstone project culminates your learning journey by tasking you with deploying a complete AI agent system.  You'll integrate all the concepts learned throughout the curriculum, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment and monitoring. This isn't just about deploying a single model; it's about building a robust, functioning system.

## Project Overview:  Smart Home Energy Management

Your goal is to deploy an AI agent that optimizes energy consumption in a smart home environment.  The agent will:

1. **Collect Data:** Gather real-time energy usage data from simulated smart home devices (e.g., appliances, lighting).  We'll provide a simulated data stream for this project.
2. **Process Data:** Clean, preprocess, and potentially transform the collected data to prepare it for model input.  This might involve handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
3. **Predict Energy Demand:**  Utilize a trained machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict future energy demand based on historical data and external factors (e.g., time of day, weather).  You can use a pre-trained model or train your own.
4. **Optimize Energy Usage:** Based on the prediction, the agent will make decisions to optimize energy consumption. This might involve scheduling appliance operation, adjusting thermostat settings, or switching to alternative energy sources (simulated).
5. **Deploy and Monitor:** Deploy the complete system using a suitable platform (e.g., Docker, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) and implement monitoring capabilities to track performance and identify potential issues.

## Project Requirements

* **Programming Languages:** Python (with relevant libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, etc.)
* **Deployment Platform:** Docker is recommended, but you can choose another platform based on your familiarity and resource availability.  Explain your choice in your final report.
* **Data Handling:**  Proficient use of Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
* **Model Selection:** Justification for the chosen model based on its suitability for the task.
* **Monitoring:** Implementation of basic monitoring to track key metrics (e.g., prediction accuracy, system uptime).
* **Documentation:**  A comprehensive report detailing the system architecture, implementation details, results, and challenges encountered.


## Project Steps

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**  Access the provided simulated smart home energy dataset.  Clean the data, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features.  Include a detailed description of your preprocessing steps in your report.

2. **Model Training (if necessary):** If you choose to train your own model, select an appropriate model architecture, train it on the preprocessed data, and evaluate its performance using suitable metrics. Document your model training process, including hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

3. **Agent Logic Development:** Develop the core logic of the AI agent that makes decisions based on the model's predictions. This will involve integrating the model with the data acquisition and optimization components.

4. **Deployment:** Package your application using Docker (or your chosen platform).  Write a comprehensive Dockerfile (or equivalent).  Deploy your application to a chosen environment.

5. **Monitoring Implementation:** Implement basic monitoring to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as prediction accuracy, system uptime, and energy savings. Log these metrics appropriately.


## Example Code Snippet (Dockerfile):

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "main.py"]
```

## Submission Requirements

* **Code Repository:**  A well-organized Git repository containing all your code, documentation, and a `README.md` file.
* **Deployment URL (if applicable):**  A link to your deployed application if you choose a cloud-based deployment.
* **Final Report:** A detailed report (PDF or similar format) describing your project, including:
    * Problem statement and approach
    * Data preprocessing steps
    * Model selection and training (if applicable)
    * System architecture
    * Deployment details
    * Results and analysis
    * Challenges and lessons learned


This capstone project is designed to challenge you and solidify your understanding of the entire AI system development lifecycle.  Good luck!

# Lesson 50: Capstone Project: Deploying a Full AI Agent System

This capstone project culminates your learning journey in AI engineering.  You will deploy a complete AI agent system, integrating all the concepts learned throughout the course. This isn't just about deploying a single model; it's about building a robust, scalable, and maintainable system.

## Project Goal: Deploy a Smart Home Energy Management System

Your task is to deploy a smart home energy management AI agent. This agent will:

1. **Collect Data:** Gather real-time energy consumption data from smart meters (simulated data can be used initially).
2. **Process Data:** Clean, pre-process, and potentially transform the data for optimal model performance.
3. **Predict Energy Consumption:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict future energy consumption based on historical data and external factors (e.g., weather, time of day).
4. **Optimize Energy Usage:**  Based on predictions, the agent should suggest energy-saving strategies (e.g., adjusting thermostat, shifting appliance usage).
5. **Actuate Control:**  Simulate the actuation of smart home devices based on optimization recommendations.
6. **Monitor & Log:** Continuously monitor the system's performance and log key metrics (energy savings, prediction accuracy).
7. **Deploy & Maintain:** Deploy the entire system using a suitable cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and implement monitoring and maintenance procedures.


## Project Requirements & Deliverables:

* **Data Acquisition:** Implement a data acquisition pipeline using appropriate APIs or simulated data.  Provide clear documentation on data sources and preprocessing steps.
* **Model Development:** Develop and train a suitable predictive model. Justify your model choice based on the data characteristics and performance metrics.  Include a thorough model evaluation.
* **Optimization Algorithm:** Implement an optimization algorithm that suggests energy-saving strategies based on predictions.  Clearly document the optimization logic and its parameters.
* **System Architecture:** Design and document the overall system architecture, including components, data flow, and interdependencies.  Consider using diagrams (e.g., UML) to illustrate the system design.
* **Deployment:** Deploy the entire system to a cloud platform. Provide instructions for deployment and access.
* **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement a monitoring and logging system to track key performance indicators.  Demonstrate how you would identify and address potential issues.
* **Documentation:**  Thorough documentation is crucial.  This includes a project report detailing the design choices, implementation details, and results.  Also provide clear, concise instructions for running the deployed system.


## Technology Stack (Suggestions):

* **Programming Language:** Python (with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Flask/FastAPI)
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure (choose one)
* **Database:**  Suitable database for storing historical data (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cloud-based solutions)
* **Containerization:** Docker (recommended for easier deployment)
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (optional, for advanced deployments)


## Example Code Snippet (Data Preprocessing):

```python
import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(data):
    # Handle missing values
    data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Forward fill missing values

    # Feature scaling (example: MinMaxScaler)
    from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
    scaler = MinMaxScaler()
    data[['energy_consumption']] = scaler.fit_transform(data[['energy_consumption']])

    return data

# Example usage
data = pd.read_csv('energy_data.csv')
preprocessed_data = preprocess_data(data)
```

## Evaluation Criteria:

* **Functionality:** Does the system correctly collect, process, predict, and optimize energy usage?
* **Accuracy:** How accurate are the energy consumption predictions?
* **Scalability:** Can the system handle increasing data volume and complexity?
* **Maintainability:** Is the code well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain?
* **Deployment:** Is the system successfully deployed to a cloud platform?
* **Documentation:** Is the project well-documented?


This capstone project is designed to challenge you and solidify your understanding of building and deploying a complete AI system.  Remember to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks, and don't hesitate to seek assistance from your instructors and peers. Good luck!

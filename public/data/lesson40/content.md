# Lesson 40: Multi-Agent Collaboration and Negotiation

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Design systems where multiple agents collaborate or compete to solve tasks.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- Agentic vs reactive systems
- Emergence and unpredictability
- Planning algorithms and goal trees
- Multi-agent protocols and messaging
- Feedback mechanisms and self-evaluation
- Industry case studies

## ðŸ§ª Practice Tasks

- Simulate emergent behavior using simple agents
- Build a goal tree and execution plan
- Create a multi-agent negotiation scenario
- Implement a feedback loop for agent refinement

## ðŸ”® Future Trends

- Fully autonomous agent ecosystems
- Agentic governance and policy enforcement
- AI agents with emotional modeling

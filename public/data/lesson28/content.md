# Lesson 28: API Orchestration and Microservices

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Design and orchestrate APIs for modular, agent-driven systems.

## ðŸ§  Overview

- MCP architecture and use cases
- Agent hosting and deployment
- Docker containers and orchestration
- API gateways and routing
- Load balancing and autoscaling
- Cost tracking and optimization

## ðŸ§ª Practice Tasks

- Set up a basic MCP server simulation
- Deploy a containerized agent using Docker
- Design an API flow for multi-agent communication
- Monitor resource usage and simulate scaling

## ðŸ”® Future Trends

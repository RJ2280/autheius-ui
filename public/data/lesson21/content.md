# Lesson 21: Building Autonomous Workflows

## 🎯 Objective

Learn to build autonomous workflows using agents and task chains.

## 🧠 Overview

- Agent vs RPA
- Agent frameworks and APIs
- Task orchestration and chaining
- Decision trees and logic gates
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Memory types: short-term, long-term, episodic

## 🧪 Practice Tasks

- Build a simple agent using AutoGen or CrewAI
- Create a decision tree for routing user queries
- Simulate multi-agent negotiation with roleplay prompts

## 🔮 Future Trends

- Self-improving agents
- Agentic AI ecosystems
- Long-context memory and planning

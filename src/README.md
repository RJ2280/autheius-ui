## Autheius AI System Tracker ##

Project: Autheius AI-Clean Frontend + Autheius Dashboard + Launchpad + Backend Maintainer: Robbie Status: 🟢 Active and growing
📜 Inception: The Vision
Autheius AI is a futuristic lesson dashboard and intelligence interface, built to synthesize AI learning, prompt mastery, and autonomous agent deployment. It collaborates with Autheius AI systems to create a complete educational ecosystem powered by generative and agentic intelligence.
🧬 Core Components
Folder Path Role
chimera-clean/ Frontend workspace UI
autheius-ui/ Neon-themed lesson dashboard (Vite + React)
chimera-backend/ Central controller: APIs, data, auth, lesson sync
chimera-autheius-launchpad/ Unified launch interface connecting all subsystems
⚙️ Completed Milestones
🔹 Project Setup
[x] autheius-ui scaffolded using Vite
[x] Neon-glass UI styling created with glassmorphism components
[x] 50 lessons injected via Bash scripts (inject_lessons_1_50.sh)
[x] Lesson cards styled and loaded from manifest/JSON
[x] React components: LessonCard, progress tracking, dashboard grid
🔹 Launch Interface
[x] Launchpad built with glass buttons linking to Autheius + Autheius AI
[x] Responsive layout with electric neon styling
[x] LocalStorage setup for session sharing (lesson selection)
[x] Routing tested between UIs
🔹 Backend Integration
[x] chimera-backend designated system controller
[x] Proposed API endpoints:
/api/lessons
/api/lessons/:id/progress
/api/capstone/upload
/api/user/progress
[x] Backend connectivity validated via safety check script
🔹 Bash Automation
[x] launch-all.sh script launches all services
[x] check_app_ports.sh validates reachability of each app
[x] Scripts created to generate frontend scaffolds, styles, and lesson JSONs
🧠 Gemini + API Access Strategy
Gemini API Key includes access to the following key services:
Generative Language API, Vertex AI, Gemini Cloud Assist
Vision AI, Cloud Video Intelligence, Transcoder API
YouTube, Drive, Docs, Slides, Tasks, Calendar
Sensitive Data Protection, Secret Manager, IAM APIs
Cloud Build, Cloud Run, Compute Engine, Datastore, App Engine
And dozens more critical GCP services for agent deployment and lesson hosting
🎯 These APIs will be leveraged in upcoming deployments, capstone publishing, and intelligent feedback loops.
📈 Next Steps
[ ] Build lesson API endpoints in chimera-backend
[ ] Sync autheius-ui to real lesson data with progress tracking
[ ] Add voice narration, video generation, and Gemini integrations
[ ] Deploy all three UIs and backend with secure hosting
[ ] Design capstone flow with portfolio preview and submission logic
